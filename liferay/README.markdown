# Customized Environment support
There are some different image configurations supported under this repository, depending on if you want to use Liferay Portal with a different database or application server.

If you are using any of the CE supported databases (**MySQL or PostgreSQL**), please **use the right Git branches** on this repository to check out the docker-compose files for each database, which will provide an additional Docker container with the supported database, linked to the container running Liferay Portal. Besides, this `README.md` file will change and describe the usage for each branch.

## Supported Databases
These are the supported Database Management System (*DBMS*):
  - HSQL
  - MySQL
  - PostgreSQL

## Supported Application Servers
These are the supported App servers:
  - Tomcat

## Branch name convention
The convention for branch names, using `-` as separator, is:
  - Liferay major version: `7`
  - Liferay community edition: `ce`
  - Liferay release: `ga5`
  - Application server: `tomcat`
  - DBMS: `hsql`

So, if you are using Liferay 7 GA5 with MySQL or PostgreSQL, you should use the `7-ce-ga5-tomcat-mysql` or `7-ce-ga5-tomcat-postgres` branches, respectively.

The git branches are named using the same convention, i.e.:

  https://github.com/mdelapenya/docker-liferay-portal/tree/7-ce-ga5-tomcat-hsql
  https://github.com/mdelapenya/docker-liferay-portal/tree/7-ce-ga5-tomcat-mysql
  https://github.com/mdelapenya/docker-liferay-portal/tree/7-ce-ga5-tomcat-postgres
